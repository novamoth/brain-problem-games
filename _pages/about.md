Brain Problem Games is a curated list of pieces of media that feature themes of:

- Mental Health Issues
- (C)PTSD and Trauma
- Dissociation
- Identity

This list is open for modification. <a href="https://github.com/novamoth/brain-problem-games">Simply submit a Pull Request to the github page, and upon approval, it will automatically be added to the website.</a> If you do not have a github account, you can reach out to me directly at @novamoth on most platforms, but this will be slower.

# FAQs:

## "Brain Problems?"

The name is slightly tongue-in-cheek, and is intended to be easy to remember while encompassing the broad scope of the list.

## I disagree with something on this list! / I disagree with a tag!

This list is deliberately designed to be extremely broad, and err towards _including_ an item. Similarly, tags are applied based on best available information, and may differ from authorial intent. This will be noted inside and individual game's entry.

## Just games?

No. This has other pieces of media. But games are my particular specialty.

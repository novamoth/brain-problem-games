Brain Problem Games is a curated list of pieces of media that feature themes of:

- Mental Health
- Neurological Disorders
- PTSD, CPTSD and Trauma
- Dissociation
- Identity

This list is open for modification. <a href="https://github.com/novamoth/brain-problem-games">Simply submit a Pull Request to the github page, and upon approval, it will automatically be added to the website.</a> If you do not have a github account, you can reach out to me directly at @novamoth on most platforms, but this will be slower.

# FAQs:

## "Brain Problems?"

The name is slightly tongue-in-cheek, and is intended to be easy to remember while encompassing the broad scope of the list.

## What makes a game qualify / I disagree with something included!

This list is deliberately designed to be extremely broad, and err towards _including_ an item. Similarly, tags are applied based on best available information, and may differ from authorial intent. This will be noted inside and individual game's entry.
As a general rule, however, the work needs to give sufficient attention and detail to the character's "brain problem". As an example, in a fictional JRPG, the main character has their home village destroyed. If they brush this off and proceed towards their magical adventure, it would not be included on this list. If the main character has hallucinations of fire or reoccurring nightmares, it would be included on this list.

## Just games?

No. This has other pieces of media. But games are my particular specialty and interest.

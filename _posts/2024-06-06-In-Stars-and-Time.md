In Stars and Time follows a group of adventurers at the end of their turn-based, JRPG-style adventure to defeat The King. The main character, the group rogue, Siffrin, dies brutally... and wakes up a day and a half in the past. They are stuck in a timeloop, able to try again and again until they overcome The King. But each loop heaps more horrific deaths upon his head, and before long, he starts to crack under the trauma. They are desperate to hide the loop from their friends, and yet desperately needs their emotional assurance.

The "Plurality" tags are a stretch: No plurality is shown, but I applied the tags because of particular heavy spoilers.
<details><summary>Spoilers for Act 6</summary>Loop is Siffrin from the previous game, "Start Again: A Prologue". They are more of a preserved echo, a ghost, than an alter. However, the game drops lines about Siffrin and Loop that makes their odd relationship similar to that between alters. Descriptions about how both Siffrins wished for someone to talk to and someone to help them through the worst situations. Casual mentions of how Loop might rejoin into Siffrin. As a result, I think that listing "Fantasy Plurality" is appropriate here.</details>

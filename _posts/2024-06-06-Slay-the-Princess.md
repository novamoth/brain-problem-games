Slay the Princess is a complex time-loop focused horror-comedy-romance. Your job, the Narrator announces, is to Slay the titular Princess. But can he be trusted? Can the princess? The two will argue with you, and you will make your choice...

And eventually, every run, it all goes dark, and you die. And then it will start again, with only you and the princess remembering your choice. She will have shifted and changed, as will you--Trauma changing you both (and giving you Voices in your head). All of this tells an evocative story about life and death, stasis and renewal, trauma and love.

Control is an interesting representation of something approximating plurality. From the outset, Jesse Faden, the main character, talks to a mostly-invisible entity, which initially goes unnamed. The player cannot hear this entity, despite playing as Jesse (and it's unclear if she "hears" responses, or if she "feels" them). The entity she speaks to acts as a living quest marker, shimmering in the direction the player needs to go, or shimmering in response to Jesse's statements.

It's a very good representation, in my opinion, of how plurality can sometimes feel, and how it looks to those outside.

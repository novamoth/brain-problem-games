Control is an interesting representation of Fantasy Plurality. From the outset, Jesse Faden, the main character, talks to a mostly-invisible entity, which initially goes unnamed. The player cannot hear this entity, despite playing as Jesse (and it's unclear if she "hears" responses, or if she "feels" them). A plural person might call this entity "non-verbal but co-conscious." The entity she speaks to acts as a living quest marker, shimmering in the direction the player needs to go, or shimmering in response to Jesse's statements. Jesse Faden has clearly and unambiguously _positive_ feelings towards this entity, and regards it closely. In the intro, she even complaints to it, hoping that "this time" would amount to something (implying that it had attempted to lead her towards what she seeks multiple times, to no avail). Similarly, she's uncomfortable when she "loses connection" to this entity. This entity is not mysterious to her, but is instead a close and trusted friend.

It's a very good representation, in my opinion, of how plurality can sometimes feel, and how it looks to those outside.

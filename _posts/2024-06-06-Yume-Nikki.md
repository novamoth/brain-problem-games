Yume Nikki is an absolute classic in the genre. But at the same time, Yume Nikki is a very difficult game to discuss because very few things are definite within the surreal, dream universe of Madotsuki's mind. In the game, you wander around her dreams, trying to piece together some semblance of a history. There's no active plot. And then, the story is over. One thing is clear: She has Brain Problems.

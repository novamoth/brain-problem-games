Omori is an extremely complicated item to include on this list as a "plural game", and one I suspect will cause a _lot_ of arguments:
- OMOCAT, the developer, has explicitly deconfirmed it
- Multiple plot points within the game get extremely uncomfortable/problematic when viewed under a plural light

But the bar for Brain Problem Games is not if something is "canon": It merely asks if people might feel _seen_ by a particular piece of media. And many, _many_ plural people _do_ feel seen by the game. Even if one was to discard all of the direct connections to Traumagenic Plurality, Omori still tells a captivating tale about dissociative amnesia and maladaptive daydreaming that many systems will feel seen by.

So, it is included on this list. Just recognize that, when viewed as a "plural game", the overall message becomes tainted and unhealthy for systems--but this reading _was not intended_ by the creator. Even so, I view Omori as a captivating game all the same.

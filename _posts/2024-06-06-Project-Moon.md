Project Moon has, at the time of writing, created three games:
- Lobotomy Corporation, a monster-management game where you run a facility that houses strange creatures
- Library of Ruina, a card-based battle game where you lure bounty hunters into The Library
- Limbus Company, a gacha game where you manage twelve "Sinners" in a stylistic card-inspired battler

Each of these brilliantly showcase mental distress and disordered thinking in a sci-fi-fantasy world. Project Moon are the masters of turning storytelling into gameplay and visa-versa, and so mental distress is strongly shown both mechanically and cinematically. To give specific examples would require direct spoilers of one or all three games, so I will leave it there. However, I will warn that each of these games are 120+ hours, and exceptionally difficult. They're well worth the effort, however, and extremely worth the effort.

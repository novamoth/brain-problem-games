Signalis is an _impossible_ game to give specifics on. It takes the notion of an unreliable narrator and pushes it to its limit. This means, predictably, those who play it fall into one of two categories: "What just happened???" and "What just happened? That is the best game I have ever played." The tags I've applied are my personal guesswork as to what is happening in the plot, but one could make an argument for literally every tag on this website (especially plurality). It is an incredibly intense, emotional horror game.

You made a promise. You will do anything.

That said, this game captures the _feeling_ of dissociation extremely accurately. Those with a dissociative disorder may want to exercise caution, due to the intensity of the experience.

Project Moon has, at the time of writing, created three games:
- Lobotomy Corporation
- Library of Ruina
- Limbus Company
Each of these brilliantly showcase mental distress and disordered thinking in a sci-fi-fantasy world. Project Moon are the masters of turning storytelling into gameplay and visa-versa, and so mental distress is strongly shown both mechanically and cinematically. To give specific examples would require direct spoilers of one or all three games, so I will leave it here. However, I will warn that each of these games are 120+, and exceptionally difficult. Well worth the effort, however.

Warframe is an online co-op game (not exactly "massively" multiplayer, but some Massively Multiplayer features such as a player economy) that was released over ten years ago. The game has had a rocky history, and yet, it remains one of the most intensely good plotlines when it comes to Brain Problems. It has the honor of having nearly every tag on this website, and for good reason.

I will not go into specifics about every single character, especially since it may spoil some of the experience. However, I will directly list off some vague examples:

- Multiple characters with Disordered Thought, such as autism
- Extremely good depictions of Trauma and how it can change you
- More Plural characters than are easily counted (both fully fantasy and Traumagenic)
- Plural characters are often very explicitly plural. Sometimes this is explicit (often more explicit the harder things lean Fantasy-plural) with small nods or call-outs to the Plurality such as a telepathic character calling someone "three headed" or wondering why she felt like two people were approaching her when only one is visible.

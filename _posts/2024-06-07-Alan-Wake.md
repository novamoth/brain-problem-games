Alan Wake is an unreliable narrator. This game series plays with the meta and the player to an extreme degree. Since there was a recent remaster, I'll avoid any direct spoilers, but I'll say that the way that the Alan Wake series tackles horror, writer's block, and mental unwellness in an interesting horror game format. A must-play.

Disco Elysium tells the story of Harry DuBois, a police officer tasked to bring a murderer to justice. Almost immediately, however, he becomes embroiled in a complex political narrative with no easy right choices. Worse still, he is _very_ mentally ill. Upon starting the game, he wakes with no knowledge of who he is, or what he's doing... and a cacophony of voices in his head attempting to make suggestions and dictate his every move. Every one of his 24 "Skills" has a unique personality, and will attempt to intrude upon conversations, changing the narrative based on your stat allocation. In one run, he may carefully analyze a set of footprints on the ground to gain the precise size of a crowd, where in another playthrough he might speak directly with the murdered corpse and divine information from the body.

Many, many Plural people remark that Harry's experience of being hampered and helped by his "skills" resonates strongly with them. Even though it is _not_ intended to be Plurality, it is no surprise people resonate--the developers phrase him as a "broken mind", something many Plural people can relate to.

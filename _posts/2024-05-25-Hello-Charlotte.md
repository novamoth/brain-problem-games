No one I've spoken to seems to know this series, and yet it has an Overwhelmingly Positive review score on steam. This series is near and dear to my heart, and manages a complex narrative that begs to be examined in detail. There's strong implication that the creator, Etherane, is trans and plural themselves (though they are not a very public person, so don't expect to find evidence of this anywhere), and it shows in the painful, evocative writing.

"Charlotte Wiltshire is an unreliable narrator."

<details><summary>Light Spoilers (Limited to game 1)</summary>The first game begins as a surreal exploration game similar to Yume Nikki. The main character, Charlotte Wiltshire, is implied to have Schizophrenia and, at the end of the first game, is possessed by the spirit of an "Oracle", a Godlike figure. The following games in the series add additional layers of unreliable narration and complexity, turning the series into a painful tale of a mentally ill transgirl, and an intense interrogation of the player.</details>

Overall, I've never seen a game that hits upon these topics in a more evocative way.
